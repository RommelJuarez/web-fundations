Without them, neither we nor most animal species could exist, it is of great importance in medicine, in the wood and paper industry, in the food industry, plants are necessary for our lives, on this page we can learn more about plants and how to benefit more from them.
a study published in 2019 by the journal Nature Ecology Evolution, showed that:<br><br>

-total of 571 plant species have become extinct.<br>
-Every year at least 2 species become extinct.<br>
-Hawaii is the place with the most extinct plants, followed by South Africa, Mauritius, Australia, India, Brazil and Madagascar.<br>
-Some of the extinct plants are part of cultivated species, so they were never introduced into nature.<br><br>
-Most extinct species are woody plants and come from the tropics or subtropics.<br><br>
