Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

-When I wrote the code for the program that generated a random landscape, 
I realized that functions have a lot of power to generate other types of 
data randomly, very useful, and that I can reuse the function. It's great.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

-Very useful for teamwork and that coworkers can be sure that 
they can reuse the functions in their code.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

-When I have a problem writing code I usually write on paper what I am doing,
what is my goal and how can I divide it into small parts so I can realize 
where I am failing and find a solution,
I can improve by using the test functions more often during the writing 
process instead of only at the end.
